1. What is the Big O for this?

   1. O(1) Constant
   2. O(n) Linear

2. Even or odd
   Constant time O(1). Since there is no loop used algorithim time is
   independent of the input size

3. Are you here?
   Polynomial time O(n^k). Nested loops create a longer algorithm time.
   The algorithm must check every item each array in each For loop which takes
   longer to complete

4. Doubler
   Linear time O(n). There is only one For loop so the running time is
   directly proportional to the size of input(array)

5. Naive search
   Linear time O(n). There is only one For loop so the running time is
   directly proportional to the size of input(array)

6. Creating pairs
   Polynomial time O(n^k). Nested loops create a longer algorithm time.
   The algorithm must check every item each array in each For loop which takes
   longer to complete

7. Compute the sequence
   Linear time O(n). There is only one For loop so the running time is
   directly proportional to the size of input(array).
   This function creates a fibonnaci sequence up to num amount of numbers.

8. An efficient search
   Logarithmic time O(log(n)). when the input significantly increases,
   the output does not. It does not check every element to succeed.

9. Random element
   Constant time O(1). Since there is no loop used algorithim time is
   independent of the input size. There is no need to check each
   inputted item.

10. What Am I?
    Linear time O(n). There is only one For loop so the running time is
    directly proportional to the size of input(array).
    This function checks to see if 'n' is a prime number and if it is
    it returns true.

11. Tower of Hanoi
    Constant time O(1).
