1. What is the Big O for this?
    1) O(1) Constant
    2) O(n) Linear

2. Even or odd
    Constant time O(1). Since there is no loop used algorithim time is
    independent of the input size

3. Are you here?
    Polynomial time O(n^k). Nested loops create a longer algorithm time.
    The algorithm must check every item each array in each For loop which takes 
    longer to complete

4. Doubler
    Linear time O(n). There is only one For loop so the running time is 
    directly proportional to the size of input(array)

5. Naive search
    Linear time O(n). There is only one For loop so the running time is 
    directly proportional to the size of input(array)

6. Creating pairs
    Polynomial time O(n^k). Nested loops create a longer algorithm time.
    The algorithm must check every item each array in each For loop which takes 
    longer to complete
